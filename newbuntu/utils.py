"""Utilities made for working on the project easier.

Not 100% sure where to draw the line for utilities and tests.
A really useful function would be something to the effect of:

    Check if a directory exists, if not create it, and raise an OSError
    if we can't do that.

Arguably test_dir_existence() would work as a method of something 
subclassing :class:`unittest.TestCase`.

System checks would be good.
Check if they have the right version of python and stuff.
