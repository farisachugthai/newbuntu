# huh so i just ran a blank `snap search` and it responded with 'interesting packages'
# htop has one. apt installs version 2.1. termux has 2.2. snap stable is 2.2. edge is 3.0?

# i'm assuming these installations are WAY bigger than the usual one would be but it's....idk more portable? i get packages i don't
# get otherwise? what is the benefit of a snap? autoupdate i guess?
# but i wouldn't want vscode from a snap. actually i shouldn't even get it from my own script i need to get it from miniconda fuck.
