Snap packages!!! Easily the highlight of 18.04

if ! [ "$(command -v shellcheck)" ]; then
    sudo snap install --channel=edge shellcheck
fi
sudo snap install signal-desktop
sudo snap install pycharm-community --channel=edge --classic

sudo snap install gitter
####### !!!!! #######
sudo snap install google-cloud-sdk --classic
# Was definitely embarassed at how excited i was to see this one



# here are some ones ill try out and come back and report on
sudo snap install gogs
also installed gogsgit and that was equally confusing. i guess i should've done any research at all before running
sudo snap install git-kraken        # [doesn't take ed25519 so that's a problem]
sudo snap install easy-openvpn      # [sp?]
sudo snap install branch-diff
slack-term

ipfs is one here
xmr-miner-gui
keepassxc if you want the security profiles!
