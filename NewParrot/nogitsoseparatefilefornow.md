# Not gonna delete yet even though I have git

So let's think. We're gonna populate /bin/ with all the scripts we need regardless because they're the fastest to write.

Then as time passes on we can start shifting everything into the newbuntu directory. While figuring out how we come up with a UI we can learn python packaging as well. Or just give up on this repo but have enough shell scripts to drop and pick up an OS relatively easy okay?

Make the shell scripts way longer.


Didn't Junegunn actually copy paste the ask.sh file you have? Use that. Break up bin into apt, snap, conda and curl installs.

Still this project isn't going much of anywhere. I have a better idea.

Notes because you're a dumbass.

I just wanted to note that in the list of packages you install by default you should A) ensure locales is there which it will be but that localehelper is also there because it's not a default install but it's on vimawesome and mighgt help on winos


So where is this os thing at?

Clean out the junk out of the local backups folder, then assume that he same
material was on the EHD, overwrite it, However remember that git is no
